# A mixture model for random graphs

Project for the course "Probabilistic Graphical Models" of the MVA master at ENS Paris-Saclay.

Paper : [A mixture model for random graphs](https://inria.hal.science/inria-00070186/document), Jean-Jacques Daudin, Franck Picard, St√©phane Robin, 2006.

This project implements in python the variational EM algorithm proposed by Daudin et. al. to estimate the parameters of a Stochastic Block Model.

## Usage

Generate a random graph with 3 clusters with the Stochastic Block Model and estimate its parameters with the EM algorithm :
```python
from src import em_algorithm, random_graph

X, Z, alpha, pi = random_graph(Q=3)

alpha_hat, pi_hat, Z_hat, _ = em_algorithm(
    X, Q=3, implementation="numpy", n_init=3, iterations=100, verbose=True
)
```

## Report

The report is available [here](report/report.pdf).

## Code

The main code is available in the `src` folder. It contains an implementation of the variational EM algorithm proposed by Daudin et. al. to estimate the parameters of a Stochastic Block Model.

## Notebooks

The following notebooks were left in the repository for the sake of completeness, but they are not necessary to run the code.
